# HelloFromScratch
An emulation of the 6502 cpu following Ben Eater's [hello world from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU).

I already had the code for the mos 6502 cpu emulation for a nes, so this was more of a test to see how hard it would be to create a new system.

This emulation and the a.out bin just prints out hello world on the screen. The display of the text is an emulation of a LCD module.
